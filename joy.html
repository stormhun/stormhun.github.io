            <b>I asked if you believed in free will
                <br>  when I already knew the answer </b>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <br>I am living 
                  <br>in the space between the walls,
                  <br>the cold black shadow covering every room  
                  <br>the gap, where I am always beating 
                  <br>the same way in as out. 
                  <br>
                  <br>four years ago, I took a psychedelic 
                  <br>and for the first time 
                  <br>I could not numb the landscape with words
                  <br>in the picture when I forgot the horizon 
                  <br>in the space I did not have time to imagine
                  <br>I saw the walls and walls and walls. 
                  <br>
                  <br>yesterday, in the place I knew I'd be 
                  <br>the girl kissed me so that I did not feel 
                  <br>her lift my earring from my unpierced ear 
                  <br>a second more and she held it dangling
                  <br>offering it - like treasure in the fog   
                  <br>and I realized why I put it there.
                  <br>
                  <br>yesterday, or 10 years ago,
                  <br>when my mother crawled towards me on the floor 
                  <br>head limp in the ecstasy of escape 
                  <br>arching, back breaking, eyes wide in the expanse 
                  <br>I saw her mind splayed open in fibers 
                  <br>saw that she was no more real than me.
                  <br>
                  <br>next time I see you, or last time I saw you, 
                  <br>I'll keep you on a string 
                  <br>tied around the way out 
                  <br>for I'd like to stay between the walls 
                  <br>where I know you're never really here 
                  <br>and never really gone. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Bar Night</strong> <br> 
            <br>Walking red through the desert, 
            <br>feeling so human,
            <br>dirty snake boots, kicking and screaming, 
            <br>bawling home from the bar, 
            <br>sick in the head, greasy thoughts stuck, 
            <br>slimy in the ears, sucker in the moonlight, 
            <br>hollow in the sand, on and on and on, 
            <br>smirking at the bouncer, who are you anymore?
            <br>Snake bites tearing skin from skin, infection spreading, 
            <br>rocks and bits of everything, strewn over 
            <br>these mountains (step by step) 
            <br>melting, boiling, recombining, 
            <br>but somehow staying - in the rhythm of it all.
