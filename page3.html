Welcome to my world, <br>
I've wanted to make my own website for a long time. One of my favorite authors has a website that she writes on every day, she even publishes a book every 
few years with the entries. I have two of her books, and I like that some days she writes multiple pages and other days she writes a single word, or just a title. 
I've been inside a lot the last two days, but it's felt nice. I can finally make a place to put my thoughts, and I like that it's completely mine. I also enjoy the
format of writing within Visual Studio Code; it makes my words come out in pretty colors and tries to autocorrect my poetry with programming commands. I've been 
trying for years to find the perfect notebook or format to make myself write. I'm sure this isn't it, but I like it for now. 
<br>
Today I woke up late and spent a few hours adjusting the site. I've been so pleased with how all of the coding has turned out. I know it isn't perfect,
and I think I'm doing a few things wrong, but I feel like it looks authentic to how I wanted it, and how often does that happen? Eventually I got on the 
bus and bought some household items (can opener, thread, notebooks) and even found some leather pants that have been on my list. All was going exactly to plan
until I got on the wrong bus going home and ended up seeing a bit more of the city than I had wanted. That's mostly how my days go here, I sit on the bus and 
think, or try and listen to the other passengers and identify the words on posters and billboards. It's lonely, and pleasant, and different for me. 
I didn't eat great today, better luck tomorrow.

We made it to entry 2! <br> Today has been a day, I've drank a lot of coffee and ventured to the store for brezeln (pretzels) and a bag of mixed wafer cookies that turned out to be 
delicious. I've been enjoying trying new food here, since I have a tendency to only eat my 15 safe foods back in 'the states'. I think for my second entry I want to have a 
take, just to start exploring the range of expression a blog can provide. I have a <strong> lot </strong> of ideas for my site, and more occuring by the day. Yesterday
I entertained having a page dedicated to the bugs I find, and today I realized that I could create a page where I review every forensic files episode that I watch. The concept
of having a highly niche passion that no other person cares about or engages with is in a word, exquisite. I think that may be true passion and perhaps even 
what it means to be human. All that to say, my take is actually about LA musicians. If Seattle is grunge, LA is jazz flute. I think that's all I have to say for the moment.
