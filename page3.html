<b>TW: ED</b>
<br><br>
<b>Ghost in (my) shell-</b> I watched another Herbs & Alters video this morning and per usual it got my little brain working. Dorian was talking about 
the isolation of ED's and just like very broad strokes what happens to your body during periods where you're restricting. It was actually 
very validating because I often forget that I did in fact follow all of the signs/stages/acheivement badges of an ED. I think we all tend 
to downplay our traumatic experiences but the truth was that I was extremely isolated during that period of my life. To the point that 
I don't remember any of the small moments from that summer. I remember going to the red woods because that was when I entered marble-world, 
and I remember going to summer camp with L because I had to decide how much of an ED I wanted to present to the 
extremely impressional children around me. I felt guilty that I wasn't eating as much as them, because I knew that I should be their healthy, 
stable role model. I remember there was a presentation mid-week about the female athlete triad, the relationship between losing your period, 
losing bone density, and losing energy. The presentation was in a scared-straight style, telling the kids that if they lost their period for 
a month they would immidiately begin losing bone density and likely get a stress fracture. If they somehow lost their period for 3 consecutive months 
they would be medically diagnosed with amenorrhea and most definitely get a stress fracture and have low bone density for the rest of their little lives. 
I remember looking around the room of hundreds of kids sitting on the floor and just feeling this sinking shame, I hadn't had my period for almost a year 
at this point. I left the presentation and told L that the presentation was a bit much, I don't remember how she responded. 
<br><br>
The other moments from that summer are completely lost to me, I think that I was spending a lot of time at home, but I have no memory of what I was 
doing. I think that I would visit M sometimes, since he was living 45 minutes away with his parents most of the summer, but I often had a breakdown 
before getting in the car to drive there, and wouldn't go. I was in deep shit, I have a few videos saved on my phone from that time and I don't think 
I knew who I was in any way, or how to speak, think, exist. Dorian spoke about the connection between ED and age-regression, which I think is a fascinating 
concept. They said that in their experience, periods of restriction often made them feel drawn to childrens activitys/toys- perhaps due to the hormonal 
supression of losing your period, or perhaps due to our societal understanding of thinness being tied to childhood/youth. I wonder if that contributed to 
my sudden decision to work as a camp counselor (a path I cannot imagine taking before or since), and further- if I was feeling afraid of growing up in 
some way? I think we all are afraid of ageing, but I also feel so good being an adult a lot of the time, L and I drove to get coffee one morning before 
the kids woke up and the power of that- I had short hair and cool earrings and I felt like one of the older girls with piercings that would go to my 
dojo all those years ago. Still, I can have grace (thank you therapy) for the fear that I was feeling towards my own development 
at this time. I was on the cusp of completely re-understanding myself as NB/male and that was about to put a lot of things into a new perspective. I was 
feeling frustrated with sex at this time, and I kept telling M that I thought I was a lesbian. In retrospect, I've learned that having an ED just represses 
your desire for sex and really any feeling at all, so my confusion might have been less gender-caused and more just the bodily/chemical reality. Still, 
I can recognize that I was standing blindfolded at the edge of a very anxious-femme cliff, about to dive into a beautiful new conception of myself but 
only feeling the rock crumbling at the edge below my feet.

        I can finally look back on the events of the last weekend now that we were all let down by the Strokes (I kid) and can move along 
with our lives. This was my first festival and I think I get it. It is (as every fucking person says) like a beautiful little bubble of solidarity, 
especially since I loved so many of the bands. I felt incredibly at peace, which incidentally is what my tarot cards 
predicted when I read last week (adding THAT to my confirmation bias). The come down is still a bit hard though, like how I never 
remember that alcohol has a come down as well.. I also missed M (is this his 
first mention in these transmissions?) since so many of the bands were ones that we listen to together. There was something absolutely 
girl-boss-exquisite about going with Q though, just the pure, raw love of friendship and listening to beautiful music together. I got 
to show her alt-J and she showed me Wolf Alice, and we both cried during Big Thief and my lord and savior Florence & the Machine. 
<br><br>
At one 
point (before the entry of the mouth harp to the stage) Big Thief was singing about her mother, and that started hitting quite intensely. 
I wonder if when (when I don't) publish these fumbled pages into my manifesto I'll look back and realize it was all just me writing to my 
mother, finally filling our journal covered in dust in her bedside drawer. I started to cry because I realized that my mother didn't 
even know that I loved alt-J, that she didn't even know where I was right then, that if she saw me here she wouldn't even recognize me. Maybe 
that means I need to let her more into my life, she did reach out after my last instagram post- asking me to please tell her what the creature 
was featured there (a hedgehog mom?) and I haven't responded, so I suppose I'm the distant one in all of this. I think I feel a bit hurt though,
since there are things that I try and tell her, and I always feel like she isn't listening. When I told her that I was going to Germany I 
explained that I was going for a semester, studying, all of it- and the week before I left she asked me who my host family was, 
and 'you're staying a few weeks? visiting Nadine?'. I know she's self-admittedly senile but it stung. I know this is a universal 
experience, that your parents never quite listen or know you, but I feel like mine might be particularly distant. It always feels a bit 
Dickens going home to the big farm house and us all sitting at the too-big kitchen table, saying nothing but keeping a traditional and 
severe reverence for each other (how warm indeed).

And here we are, arriving and leaving - on the train again. And where are we going? Q and I are an hour outside of Berlin, 
about to enter the ascension point, I slept for an hour last night and since then I've been pitter pattering about street trees,
having a lovely time with Q, thoroughly appreciating the view as our train coasts into the daylight- 
<br><br>
I knew that I was going to like Berlin, and so maybe that's part of the reason I do like it, so much. I don't remember if I felt this 
way about Portland too, that it was a dream- then became the only place that I could imagine myself being, then of course- after a few 
months reality began to set in. There are concrete things that I like here though, things I can pinpoint beyond just a carefully-curated 
global aesthetic that Berlin has managed to seed in my heart since I started German classes at 15. I like the wide streets, it makes 
moving through the city feel so peaceful, nobody is in your way or angry with you. On my run yesterday I felt that I could run comfortably 
anywhere in the city, and what a beautiful prospect for me. Berlin streets are quiet and lead into beautiful 
gardens and large swaths of undeveloped land, sections of forested swamps and fields right in the center of the city. It feels so balanced,
the line between STREET and TREES (!) - I also like the people here, so far the festival goers and the shop keepers have all been lovely, 
someone rode by on their bike yesterday and told me I was doing great on my run, it's the little things. 
<br><br>
I suppose I have conflicting 
feelings about this love I feel for Berlin. I'm weary of it, like all love, because there is always the possibility that it won't last. 
I'm not sure how I first felt drawn to Portland, likely it was catalyzed by Portlandia as sad as that is to admit (although I do love that 
show still), I think Portland represented a freedom for me that Seattle didn't. Seattle was a known quantity, my parents both understood 
and knew their way around there, we'd spent days there together, that was their city. But Portland could be mine, and it was marketed as 
open, queer, weird, etc. Was it everything that I expected? I suppose, but I realized that Portland has a slimy coating to it- an incredible 
and palpitable hypocrisy that is at once acknoledged in most circles (the ever present antifa mantra 'we hate Portland'), and simultaniously
has only gotten more severe in the time I've lived there. I know I'm not the first to say this but the claim that Portland is a woke 
city while thousands of people are sleeping on the streets and in their cars -- it's unforgivable. Portland is a sham, it's people who are 
constantly presenting themselves as better/different/poor/cool while inside they don't even understand why they are doing any of it. Maybe 
that's just college, and of course I am no exception- I'm constantly presenting, seeing what works, adjusting, trying to put forth 
something at once grudge and at the other- professional. It's a ridiculous dance - but I haven't noticed it present here. It doesn't feel 
like we are clawing at each other, perhaps communal (!!) is more what I'm trying to say. 
<br><br>
Anyway, I thought I should tell you all that I literally communicated with alt-J yesterday. We made a few friends at the show before and 
I was absolutely unhinged talking about how excited I was for alt-J. It paid off (like always) because this very tall fellow offered to 
lift me up on his shoulders for a song since he could tell that I was absolutely rabid. He said to just tap him when I was ready which 
presented an incredible decision to me of what blessed/perfect song I should choose to ascend to (having a vague knowledge of the 
set list from their Seattle show but of course unsure if their festival show might be different). I tried to go deep inside and know that 
I would feel when the time was right, and of course, as alt-J always does, I felt the moment perfectly. Of course, I should ascend to 
Chicago <br><br>
<i> an apparition lifts me up / from its shoulders I sit and see your face above the tree-line </i> <br>
<i> your reassurances subtited in American English / I am calm as we sail down the hillside </i>
<br><br>
It was beautiful, I was seen and loved and cherished by my favorite band for one little moment. Maybe sometimes, dreams do come true. 
Enough of this, I'll catch you guys later.

Oh God, I really should be getting started on my long run- or the coding I need to work on for D (not that one)- but I really want 
to write about something- or maybe just prolong the time until I need to move my body through space for 1.75 hours. I was speaking with 
a friend about this earlier this week, I think I may have come off fake deep and overly 'psychology major', but she was studying 
sociology so I'm not sure if she cared. But what I was trying to convey was the interesting nature of sport and exercise in the grand 
scheme of one's day, that we as humans have an innate need to move through space, in the same category as eating/drinking/sleeping. And
you're probably thinking, okay you ableist cunt (reclaimed)- that must be so great for you but people can live really fulfilling lives 
without incessant movement, and I'm sure that's true - I'm speaking from within the confines of my own body, one that both liberates 
and holds me hostage, and saying that my body's need to fling itself through space is something that I find so primal. M responded to this 
saying, yes, it's about getting out of your head. And she's right, but also wrong. During the worst periods of my ED I could not run, 
but it wasn't physical, it was because I would stop at the edge of the track and cry, completely unable to control (IN THE MOST 
FUCKED SENSE OF THE WORD) my body, feeling 
only an overwhelming hatred, that I wanted to grasp myself in iron hands and shape myself into someone else. I couldn't move because 
moving was an invitation to be so inside of my body, which meant escaping my thoughts, but at that time they were indistinguishable.
Every thought was body, and acknowledging any piece of myself was like pressing a seering pan into my head. So now we must emerge from 
this inexplicable (but so societally-crafted) line of thinking and explore 'now', when my body is okay-and I do not need desperately 
to be someone else. 'Now', I imagine myself as a vector in space, only lines crossing lines and true free movement becomes possible again. I MUST 
remember to <b>see out, not in</b>, and in the words of fellow mover (and shaker) Robert Frost, 'that has made all the difference'.

It's 5:30 am and I've already been asked if I was married. I made the age-old mistake of nodding to someone who had nodded to me on the train platform 
while we took our seats, and answered him when he asked me where the plug was for his phone. I should have realized that I was his target from the beginning, but of course
I tried to give him the benefit- pretty soon I was sitting with a knot in my stomach while he stared directly at my downturned face, his scrawny leg splayed out towards me, 
implicitly blocking my escape route. It is in moments like this that I want to go beserk. What I actually say is 'I'm moving', but what I want to say is so much greater. 
Maybe I should have said more, because he came knocking at my new seat a few minutes later, starting with a wave saying 'it's fine' before coming to sit across from me 
again and tell me more about his phone charger. This time I said I wanted to sit alone, to which he suddenly pretended he didn't speak english, or perhaps was so 
shocked that I had actually said it, that I had to repeat myself and say please move, please do not sit here. He gave a look of grave mutual understanding, 'of course', 
and then sat one row back, still facing me, and staring somehow more intensly now with his head bent against the window, his eyes both scared and searching. <br><br>
I've moved a second time, and now the sun is beginning it's peaceful rise, how comforting that cool blue sky comes. I read a short story yesterday, 'the Scarlet Ibis'
recommended by B (who else?), and it did enliven something in me. The story is remarkably short, you could likely read it in a shorter time than this blog entry, but 
hits so intensely, guilt/loss/the strangness of siblings. T is going to be coming to Germany in the next month and it's been lightly on my mind. I'd like to share 
my website with him, perhaps in a misguided try at openness like my mom's shared journal approach, but nonetheless a try.

I have one more thing- I'd like to celebrate how far I've come in the last 3 years with writing, and with general cognitive function, by sharing a poem I wrote 
and TEXTED to D, on Nov 18. 2018. I'm also doing this to celebrate the loss of this cowboy from my psyche, for when I think of him now, I feel less than nothing, 
more like pity. Here goes:
<pre>
    The night train is in my head 
    shaking my frizzy hair into my hands 
    my cardboard walls rumble with the gravel 
    as the train rushes through stagnant air 
    screaming hollow notes as 
    though it might arrive 
    suspending me for fear of missing 
    your soft knock 
    on my walls pulsing and 
    trembing to catch 
    my flushed body spread too thin 
    burning halls, fleshy streets, 
    yanking me 
    Back! Back! Here's the train! 
    desperately pressed to jagged walls 
    so thin I know the train will tear 
    right through and you 
    will hear the somber call and 
    you will come 
    But your walls are sturdy, quiet 
    as I send tendrils searching 
    the harsh night 
    for a few light footprints on the moon 
    heard so far between wake and sleep 
    It's only another dull thudding 
    on the tracks 
    My walls are glowing red,
    alarm bells at the station
    but you enter your silent planet 
    and sigh 
    for how wonderful to sleep so soundly 
    indifferent to the symphony next door. 
</pre>
Wow, they really said.. For added context D responded to this saying 'I like this poem. Sorry I never got back to you yesterday'. If I was to revamp this poem now 
there's many words I would change- although I was interested to see my use of 'fleshy streets', a metaphor I used just early this week, 'cracks in the sidewalk/the 
stripes on your backbone'. I guess I wanted to share this since I just called someone else cringe, and it's hard to say that with this skeleton in my closet. I think 
after years of consideration of the <strong>big</strong> question (is it better to have loved and lost?), I always fall on the side of Florence and the Machine <br>
<i> you need your rotten heart, your dazzling pain like diamond rings <br>
    You need to go to war to find material to sing </i> <br>
Although- I'm still not sure what she's actually saying in that song. In any case, while I hate the player (not the game), I think this poem does capture something 
about living in the dorms my freshman year of college. The rampant depth of suffering exerted there - talk about ghosts in the walls - and the complete lack of control 
that I was feeling, which perhaps should have been noticed by a trained professional before it spiraled into ED marble-world a few short years later. With this, 
I'd like to say a soft 'git along lit'l doggy', and move on with my life, thank you for your service, D.

Well, I shared my poetry yesterday- in front of real, alive, people. I'll be honest, I think my words are only meant to be read against a garish 2000's 
colored computer screen, ever-reminding my readers that these sentences are contrived, expected, and could (and maybe should) have been written 25 years ago. I don't think that 
I do well with speaking either, but that would probably be aided if my poems were better. I did like performing 'small talk', since I 
think it warms the audience well to recieve anything else I have half-a-mind to throw at them. In writers' group before the reading we also did 
a small exercise in which we write until our hand hurts (or in my case, got too clammy to hold the pen) and then made a haiku with the resulting 
mish/mash. We all ended up sharing our haiku's at the reading so I will transcribe mine here <br><pre>
Heidelberg, you rap 
scallion - your wings warm and 
open like my page. 
</pre>
I suppose I like it, mostly because I got to teach 40+ german and argentinian people what 'rapscallion' meant. I'd also like to remember the 
building that we used for the reading, called Palais Rischer- a three story, pink builidng standing right in the center of the old city. I 
learned about this building when I went out for drinks with the clarinetist (musician #2), but was mostly just tagging along with F and 
trying to understand if I was having a moment of crippling anxiety or , not. The clarinetist pointed at this grand, pink palace while we were 
outside the neighboring dive bar and told us that he used to live there, that it was an artist collective where 10 lucky, lucky people just 
collaborate- make music, paint, draw, fuck, host parties- to make matters worse, at this exact moment the clarinetist caught sight of a figure 
sitting poised in one of the third floor windows and said 'oh! that's my friend!' At which stunning point he called up to her and she looked down 
at us gracefully, her hair even falling slightly out the window. He asked her if she wanted to join us for drinks and she laughed softly, gave a 
flirtatious and so artistic 'no', and turned back to what I can only imagine was pondering her fucking existance. <br><br>
Heidelberg, you rapscallion. Yesterday I entered the palace for myself, one of those moments that you just know is coming- just not sure what maze 
of decisions will lead you there. It was more organized than I expected, with a large performance space, stage, even wooden chairs stacked against 
the wall. A few artists were sitting in a small courtyard that could be seen through the wide palace windows, and god did they look the part. One 
of them had very close-cut black hair and wide billowing pants that looked unbelievably expensive, I think she was wearing those huge, white 
Balenciaga sandals as well (retailing for 546 €). She softly lit the candles in the window sills and then popped outside to water a few flowers. I hope 
that I'm telling the truth when I say, I did not envy her. Those sandals are cringe as hell. More broadly- the idea of a artist palace is a bit cringe 
unto itself, I understand the need for such collaborations (similar to the need for some to make harrowing sacrifices working on deadliest-catch style 
Alaskan fishing boats), but utmost broadly: what can you really say about the world when you are living like this? In the same vein as the girl who 
read a poem in response to Rupi Kaur that was really just saying the same words but longer- it's not the type of art I'm into. One of the people in my 
group asked me how Heidelberg could possibly be a 'rapscallion', I said it's funny because it's not.

        <b>TW: My Mom</b>
        <br><br>
I wanted to write about my mom today, I've felt it in the air the last few days, 'tell me about your mom?', 'what is she like?'. I'm often 
filled with - as Howe perfectly put it - 'a cherishing so deep' for my mother, as I think we all feel sometimes. I love to see my mother in me, 
I would love to simply live as her. Maybe there's more to say there. <br><br>
My mother is an alcoholic, but you already knew that. I should say 'was', she wasn't drinking when I went home the last time, but I think that 
'is' is appropriate, seeing as it lingers with us, unsaid and unheard in the fibers of my house. When I decided to talk with L about my mom I 
realized how badly I wanted to relive it all, over and over again just saying the facts and hearing what had happened, making it real so that 
I could know that I had not dreamed it. I wanted to tell her everything, every moment that I had felt that crumbling, that anger, hatred. I wanted 
her to tell me it was fucked up, and she did. She told me she was a child of addiction too, that I could go to Al-Anon, and that I would be 
welcomed. Maybe this isn't the best place to say it all, at the end of the day it's just a story- and in many ways I'm grateful that my mom 
taught me this lesson - that nothing is perfect. A funny thing happens when you tell a story, it is suddenly measured against, 'well how bad was 
it?', 'that's all?'. I know, dearly beloved reader, that you would never think such a thing, but it often happens that I do have those thoughts. That the words
come out and I realize, that's all. <br><br>
My mother's greatest flaw is that she cannot speak with me. She's always known this too, she asked me if I would like to write letters to each 
other when I was a child, so we would write in a book and leave it for each other to read. I love my mother, but how the fuck was a 7 year old supposed to 
write a letter? I wish we had a system like this now, but expectedly after a few weeks the journal disappeared and I believe she 
keeps it hidden in her bedside drawer. I'm sure I would cry if I read those letters now, so it's perhaps for the best that they've been taken 
from me. <br><br>
I often wonder what would happen if I shared my most personal feelings and experiences with my mom. I think she would be hurt, I think she 
would laugh. I wonder if I came here because of this breaking point, to force myself to come to terms with the person I am, the person who is 
so incredibly different from my mother. I grip my idea of her so tightly, wind myself around it and tell myself that I cannot ever show that 
I have turned a corner. I am afraid of showing her how far apart we really are, that I love the thrill of vulnerability, that I want her to know my 
deepest secrets. My mother taught me the pain of dishonesty, of sweeping things so far under the rug that they reach our core, and simmer there. 
I do not ever want to have those moments with you, lovely reader, the moments when my father pretended to be asleep, when my mom scratched at my door and came begging to be let in, only to 
touch my face in cold/clammy fingers and ask me finally in a neauseous slurry 'have you had sex yet?', 'do you hate me?'. The moments I locked her 
in her room, back to the door as she knocked and begged like a child, until the next morning - when she would leave my cereal on the table, 
and we would be filled with that all-encompassing silence, still buzzing in my ears.
<br><br>
I hope you are okay with this, my beautiful and cherished reader- that I must relive these nightmares sometimes. Can you blame me for oversharing? 
When all I ever had to express with was a journal locked by my mother's bed. I hope that you let these memories float right through you, 
like dreams, the way that I do. I buried them into the anger then, kept them sealed in the oddest little memories, the perfect light shine 
of the Heineken bottle that soaked it all up, until that was almost all there was, just pictures of that bottle, always still half-full.

During my ascension/descension I finally got around to changing the website name, since the truth is I chose 'Cyber Hunter' in about 1 second 
(pretend like you didn't already know that). So why <i>STREET TREES</i> ? - personally street trees strike me as these incredible figments of artificiality 
in our daily lives, planted so fucking deliberately, watered and fertilized and cared for to create the perception of nature, where nature already lies. They 
are a perfect idea of nature, the story we create about living harmoniously within the natural world, and god do we cultivate them. Isn't that also the fiction 
of writing? Nature, the events, the reality above the cave has happened, has caused real change in me - and all I can do is view it from this human binary of 
good/bad, wrong/right, nature/infrastructure. What street trees do I decorate my mind with? Lovely and withering and formed into these perfect charactures of what is undoubtedly real, but 
so cloaked in the frality of words and archetypes that they become undoubtedly human.  
<br><br>
Enough pitter/patter I would like to come back to how I am doing. Bad. It saddens me that other languages don't have the rhythmic beauty of 
the phrase 'dull ache of heartbreak', it helps somehow, reminds me that this is so human. I think often when I am in a depressive mood I wish 
that something would happen, like to be finally finished with something- have time for something else- but the last few days it feels like there 
is somehow nothing that I want. There is nothing that I can imagine happening that would shake this feeling, I know that it is simply what 
must pass. It reminds me of being sick, and my mom reminding me that I have to drink water. I'm back to trying to hold the line, follow my rules 
and stick to my routine and I hope that soon things will return to normal. It's funny how memory works huh? How each feeling is really just 
reopening a different feeling, one that happened a long time before.

        <b> This entry is written for me, please be careful wading through and do not read if you are in a vulnerable place, 
            TW: ED</b>
        <br><br>
            I've gone through a period of ascension, and decension, somehow simultaniously. I've relapsed and opened 
            a part of myself that I fight to cover day in/day out, like noticing that a small thing seems to always 
            make you cry. Where this thought took hold and 
            multiplied in my mind I cannot pinpoint, although I have theories. Perhaps it was D, the moment that I 
            fell off the deep end for likely the rest of college, or perhaps 'grew up' is another way of saying that. It 
            may have began with S, someone perhaps equally fleeting and beautiful as the person who has just left me. S 
            was the epitome of unrequited, I wonder if beautiful people feed off of the way that we throw ourselves 
            at their feet. I wonder if S ever believes they are unworthy. It may have been caused by a simple change in 
            scenery. In the fields of rural Washington, the last notes of the suburbs drying up as the roads turn 
            outwards and languish, forgotten as they furrow towards the mountains. In the small town where my grandmother was crowned 
            princess back in the 1940s, where I was torn to shreds (inside) every moment of middle school and then 
            slowly built, carved like marble into an unshakable form. I could understand the rhythm of the people, knew 
            every secret that they told, if you were beautiful there, you were beautiful, there was nowhere else. <br>
            And then one day I left, took my unshakable beauty and catapulted into a city where everyone was noticed, 
            and so noone was. What did I have? It didn't sink in for a while, that I had lost something when I drove away
            from that little glimmering crystal of being someone in a small town. Not only noticed, but treasured, have you ever 
            been told 'you are the most beautiful person I have ever seen'? <br>
            And what does it mean to be beautiful? Held in the eye of you/them/him, someone who reminds you of someone 
            else, someone who you covet. C was exceptionally beautiful, which is what they told me at the bar. I must believe,
            before this pain took hold- freshman year of college when this dark snake wrapped around my unshakable form and laughed when I tried to 
            fight it off, to reach again what lies beneath- that I would have let C go. I would tell myself, 'there will be others, love that they 
            are gone, love that they have taught you something'. But instead I am left speaking with the snake, and it 
            laughs that I would believe C, the absurdity, the audacity that I did not realize that C was lying. That I was 
            so desperate to hear those words I looked past reality, my only reality- the coiled snake. And so the snake binds 
            me to these figures, these stones sinking in my soup, cracking my skull with their smallest word, touch, the thoughts 
            they do not have. The snake is devilish, it doesn't tell me that I am bad, it tells me that I am delusional for thinking 
            I am good. <br><br>
            So no I will not eat, not yet. I am conversing with the snake, for maybe I can make it see reason if I can 
            just hold a bargaining chip, the scrap of control that comes with bodily mutilation. There is so much pain here, for 
            wanting to just have control, to have a body that is beautiful so that I believe it, so that I'm released. But what is 
            beauty? Masculinity, the body that you covet, wanting to remember the fading memory of someone else. Is there 
            anyone out there - another hopeless transmitter drinking cold coffee at 11 am and trying desperately to 
            fix themselves - who would be released if they looked like me? What does it mean to be released, if when I was free 
            I never even knew what this pain felt like. Now that I've left, I know too much to run back. 
            <br><br>
            Ascension. C told me that they are in therapy too, and that the only way to move forward is with brute force. I was in an 
            odd mood of using exclusively platitudes for 3 days, and responded with 'fake it until you make it'. Pain comes heavy on me, 
            souring my recollection, but also there is exhilaration coupled to it- the excitement that I have hit on something. Like when 
            I think about my friends in that little town, and start to cry. C is gone now, and we will likely never speak again. But 
            I have them too, I must remember that. In the forest of my own perception, skewed and upside-down and tinted in a thousand 
            untraceable colors, within the marble, the kafkaesque nightmare/freedom of being the main character of this world. C is gone now, 
            but in the story that I tell myself we could have never met. There is only one thing in this wasteland that I can control, 
            and that is the story I tell. C helped me see the snake, not slaughter it (lanced in viscious and gruesome victory) but feel the 
            weight of it, C was not lying- but beauty is so much more than biology or symmetry or confidence or masculinity- beauty is molding 
            someone to the story we are telling. Cramming them into an archetype/a wish/a dream and soothing ourselves, whispering 'it is real, 
            they are real', taking their ugly fragile body and measuring up, always returning to ourselves, little creatures lost in the thick of it. 
            <br><br> I am not better, I am not soothed but I will eat. Relapse can be such a welcome word, quantifiable, expected, normal, 'everyone 
            relapses at some point', but how much pain has come from this little phrase. Mom, relapsing- or maybe she was never out of it at all, 
            because she seemed to never know when the snake had caught her. 'Fake it until you make it', eat until you are full. The rest will follow 
            if you just stick to the steps, and slowly the inner realm will change, the clouds will clear and you will be happy that you met C.

        <b> I'm afraid I did not sleep </b><br><br>
         I didn't sleep last night, and I forgot what it felt like. I forgot the moment of relief when the sun rises, and you no longer need to worry about what you are 
         doing and where you will end up and how you will get home and if you will get any sleep, because it's all over. I forgot that I used to get high off this feeling. 
         It's been years since I just stayed up a whole night, but I used to do it so often, unbelievably often, it seemed like every night back when I was 17-18. F and I 
         would stay out until my shift began at 4:30 and then I'd sit in the lifeguard chair as the early morning light appeared through the window I faced. And the 
         accomplishment I would feel, knowing that I'd broken the societal rules and gotten away with it. I have more to say but the tiredness just hit me, maybe that's 
         important to say, too. Also I saw a hedgehog and read my last entry aloud to actual people, who am I . 
         <br><br>
         Later that same day: I regret to inform myself that I must now write a 250 word aufgabe (assignment) describing the city of Heidelberg for the ever-emotional 
         Kreativ Schreiben 2. I'm supposed to use the city descriptions we read in class, from the likes of Joseph von Eichendorff, Friedrich Hebbel and the brothers Grimm to
         eloquently and <i>creatively</i> relive my first moments in the town that shines "gleich einer goldenen Krone (like a golden crown)". <br><br>

         My first assignment and translation are linked here for curious little readers:

        I think I'm starting to get used to living here, and I no longer feel a drumming anxiety when I go to bed or wake up in the morning. It's more like a sharp bolt 
        that passes right when I start to look at it. Maybe through this art and my time here, I'll be able to begin interrogating the very core themes that I've felt surrounded 
        by since childhood. I'm talking about my fear of being alone, of being isolated. The fear of being left completely abandoned, of having nothing. When I was a child I 
        tried to run away once, I was serious about it too- I wanted to be completely in control for once, to lead my own life probably in a Boxcar Children fantasy. Yet, there has
        always been an unease, like thinking about the life of your aquaintance, the girl you barely knew, and her home, and her room and the people she knew that were all 
        completely normal to her. And she says all the things that she is supposed to, and she talks to all of those people and lives obiediently in her house, but all the while 
        she is trapped there, she could never enter your life, your room, wake up in your bed and survive there. Just like you can never enter hers. This pre-destination terrifies me, 
        that we are all locked in/driven in like nails to a society that we do not even see or understand. I want to be alone, but I'm terrified of losing this thread to reality. 
        What if I did completely unhook my life from these scenes and memories? What if I convinced myself that the bedroom I remembered and the words my grandmother used to say 
        to me had happened to that other girl, that they were never part of me? What could I be, if I was so completely in control? I feel like I'm always playing with this fear, seeing 
        how close I can get to it before it gets too intense, and I fall back to myself again.

        <b> TW: ED </b>
        <br><br>
        Yesterday, I went to a poetry workshop hosted by T, a new friend that I had met the night before at the jazz club (go figure). I'm beginning to feel a bit more connected 
        with the Heidelberg community, and even spoke to a few strangers at the jazz club, unprompted! I suppose I feel proud of the work I'm doing, especially after getting hyped up 
        by my therapist yesterday afternoon- but I know I still have a long way to go. I complained to lovely therapist L that I felt like I had regressed, that I was disappointed that 
        speaking with strangers has gotten progressively more difficult- she validated this and told me that if we could bottle the fearlessness and energy of a child we would be 
        superhuman, that societal messaging tells us we are never good enough, that we are always unworthy and uninteresting. She also reminded me that as I move into ED recovery,
        I will no longer have that as a numbing agent/coping strategy, which can often lead to increased anxiety. This gave me some optimism, since it feels logical/tangible and 
        makes me think my anxiety might even decrease on its own as I become more used to the feelings I had been covering up for the last few years. Not being able to use restriction as a crutch for social 
        anxiety is difficult, in a very direct way that I hadn't fully grasped before. I can no longer convince myself that I must be interesting for people to talk to, because I'm 
        slowly starving myself. Instead, I have to find new and more sustainable ways to convince myself that I'm interesting, like being the judge/jury/executioner of an poorly 
        aligned html website.

        <b> </b>
            I haven’t been able to write much in the last few days as a friend from many years ago came to stay with me. One of the good parts of growing up is getting to 
            say things like that, 'I haven't seen her in 6 years, I'm excited to meet her again.' F is someone who has inspired me at many points in my life, and laid the groundwork 
            for me being in Germany at all, she's someone I can see myself in- but also the way that German culture has shaped her, and the way American culture shaped me. 
            The last few days F showed me the weaknesses in my anxiety, how resistant I am to speaking with strangers and how uncomfortable I find meeting new people. I think something 
            happened to me in the last few years to cause this, because I think I used to feel excited when I spoke with new people, but now I often feel like something is wrong,
            like I'm saying the wrong thing, like there is a pressure in the air, like I'm starting to disassociate. I feel like I lose the thread of what we are all doing- <br><br>
            What is a conversation supposed to be? When do we know that it has gone well? Or badly? <br><br> F (perhaps seemingly) has none of these thoughts, she has no resistance to 
            walking up to a group of strangers, she'll go door to door in her building meeting her neighbors- and it works - F is rarely alone. She is loved and respected, and she has 
            many people she can call on for help. I still believe that my most precious value is COMMUNITY - yet this outreach process seems so unnatural to me, I feel like I'm 
            making myself jump into cold water, does everyone feel that way? After a few days of watching F work, I felt more confident around people. I walked into my friend's apartment 
            and felt that it did not matter where I stood, what I said, but that nothing would go wrong. I'm sure this confidence will dissipate, but I wonder if it's part of 
            what I'm supposed to learn here. Logically- I know there are a few reasons why my anxiety may have increased in the last few years, I lived through an eating 
            disorder, I felt and named body dysmorphia, I asked to be viewed as queer and non binary, I met people who manipulated me. Even listing these, and having my generalized 
            anxiety diagnosis close to my heart, it's painful to realize that you are no longer as strong as you were before. It's sad to see that your mind is injured, has grown 
            cold and frightened and that as I learned to name these feelings and cope and heal, there were always parts of myself that fell away, I couldn't possibly hold it all.

            Creative Writing </b><br> Yesterday was my first day of creative writing class, held in a thin room on the third floor of an intimidating block of building on the 
            Neckar river bank. How's that for syntax? I sat centered at the back of the class, my back to a oversized glowing window looking out over the river and the CASTLE, 
            how quaint. My teacher was incredibly attractive and I can already tell its going to be a long term. The class reminds me of being in my sophomore year english class.
            We work on creating more complex sentences and building feeling, not simply stringing facts together. It's funny to me that I struggle with this so much while 
            writing in German. In our first exercise, I wrote 5 sentences about what I had done yesterday, translated they read "I went to University Place at noon. / I ate a pretzel with 
            cheese. / I met with my friends. / We talked about our day at school. / I went home and was asleep by eleven." My friends shared their sentences and I immidiately 
            realized that my pretzel story was unbelievably lifeless. My hot professor corrected my sentences and said nothing about them, although he had made a cutting remark about German 
            level when the class started (letting us know that if you happened to be an A2 level (my placement score) there was no shame in switching to the easier class as they still had 
            spots available). I can tell that this class is going to be emotionally difficult for me, as one tiny hot professor telling me I can't write could seal my fate and spell the end 
            of Cyber Hunter altogether. Perhaps I should start providing translations of my blog posts, although I'm guessing my posts would decrease in complexity and length until I'm writing 
            to you all about pretzels and cheese exclusively. 
            <br> On a more global scale- what does it mean to be bad at your passion? And what is a passion anyway? I often wonder if I got the idea that I could write from my second-grade 
            teacher, who asked us to write a creative story- the results of which were surprisingly similar to what I produced in my current class -I actually remember exactly what I wrote, 
            it's only one sentence hanging on the wall in my mom-mom's house. It is exerpted here in it's entirety: 
            <br><br><i> 'I love the seaweed' said Trevor, a ten-year-old boy, as we swam deeper into the dark secrets of the sea.</i>
            <br><br> From my scattered memory, I had fully intended to complete the assignment and continue my fan-fic style deep sea adventure, but my teacher liked my first sentence so 
            much that she gave me an alternate assignment, coloring a special page with my sentence as a gift for my mom-mom. That small action conviced me that I had potential as a writer, a thought 
            so fragile yet persuasive that it still occurs to me as I sit against the window in kreative schreiben 2. Maybe one of the sentences I'll write here will have the same 
            draw as my second-grade sea shanty, and I'll finally make it big- but I'm guessing there's a bit more to it than that.

    Anxieties : Today I want to investigate this word, as today has been an anxious one for me. On a etymological level, I love the 'x' in anxiety, it captures a feeling
    of unease but also of uniqueness, what would our lives be if we were never afraid? 
<br><br> My anxieties have become a bit more managable, after learning to see the steps that lead me to these feelings, I'm more able to rationalize that they are only manifestations
of deeper questions that ground my life. I often feel anxious when I feel that I am taking the "easy" way in my life, that I'm not steering true to myself. Today I knew that I would 
feel anxious, as I was sleeping most of the day after staying out most of the night. Even rationalizing this decision to stay late at the Mannheim club, since I knew that experiencing
the late night club scene was more important to me than a well-rested Sunday, I still experienced self loathing and fear today. Drinking adds to my anxiety as well, for many 
obvious reasons, too straightforward to bother mentioning. I think I'm deeply afraid of who I am becoming, as though my body and self were a runaway train- and as my microscopic decisions 
build myself- every tiny moment becomes integral to me. me being me constantly. me never letting myself drop, because what if I'm really not that great? It quickly becomes too big, 
there is no self and there is only a collection of every moment that the people in my life share with me. I was only me to the people in the club last night, and when I saw noone today, I was effectively 
erased for those many hours. More than that, my interactions that define me aren't even mine, they exist only how they are percieved by the other. My therapist would respond to this (speaking of 
the self being kept in the other) by asking me to consider my core values and beliefs, those that exist regardless of my small daily decisions. It doesn't need to get so big, I can simply value 
community, value love, and the decisions I make will always align with that in some twisted way. Of course I can act unethically, but I am acting as myself and following 
these guiding values, and when I make mistakes I am acting as someone who values love, and the mistakes that come with that.

but maybe this is enough. It’s interesting the things we value in our day, and the things that feel like wasted time. 
<br> I spent about 3 hours this morning creating a flower border, which felt a bit meaningless—and yet I would work 3 hours at the lab washing glass wear, 
and feel fulfilled. I think the question comes down to what will pay off, and what time will be forgotten about. When I was in 5th grade I would stay in from
recess every day to work on my wix.com class website...and look at me now. More broadly, there’s the question of my intentions for the day—how do I want to 
feel at the end of it? Perhaps I should be one of those people who meditates, because I often feel like this question causes me anxiety that is never resolved. 
Maybe someday I’ll even be like that activist who set himself on fire (an anecdote I’m sure will soon be lost to time). I think I’m feeling like I haven’t fully 
taken advantage of my "time in Germany" today, but isn’t it funny how that anxiety just further detracts from my time here? Maybe if I do some Duolingo 
I’ll feel better.

It's sunny today, and I can't see what I'm typing due to the glare on my computer screen. Today I worked on connecting CSS to my existing code so that I can make more
complex pages, namely add a flower border to my poems page. I was inspired by B to give my site a bit more of a narrative structure, so that you feel a bit more guided through
the (cyber) space. An artist that I greatly admire (M) posted a book excerpt yesterday that resonated with me. It was setting a scene in great detail, describing a landscape rebuilding after a flood. 
I wish that I could write a book in which I just establish scenes and settings. Perhaps there's more room for poetic liberty when describing a scene, since some places can feel truly magical or dreamlike, 
even in our daily lives. 
<br> I'm on the train now, facing backwards as I'm pulled through the warm countryside. A bee landed on the smooth plastic at my elbow and I watched it until it flew away. 
My neighbors on the train seem sleepy and subdued in the mid-afternoon sun, as though they are resigned to the hot summer months ahead of us. There is a breeze now, and coolness in the purple 
rocks where the lizards live. We enter each village like a snake in the grass, surfacing long enough to steal a few weary passengers before diving back in the cool, green meadows.

<br>Today was my first day of German school. The google translate extension on my computer translates the name of my class to 'Mermaids, Robbers, and Gold-Diggers: 18th-19th 
Century Ballads' which I think may be a slight mistranslation but I appreciate the ambiguity of "Gold-Diggers". One thing about Germany is their doors, they are ridiculous. I get nervous
enough walking into unknown buildings searching for my class on the first day, I can't also be faced with opening giant wooden doors that look like they haven't moved since the pre-industrial era. 
My professor was nice though, and smiled at me after I stumbled through my three sentence presentation on types of metaphorical (nicht nur topographical) boundaries in ballads. This was 
a few minutes after I had to reveal to the class that I could not name one (1) single German ballad. Luckily I wasn't the only one. Later I realized that almost all of the German texts I had 
read last term for German literature were, in fact, ballads. We live and we learn.

<br>It's the start of a new week, and my laundry is in the dryer. Highlights from the last weekend include but are not limited to: <br>
 - Getting a tour of Heidelberg and solidfying (by who's metric?) my first new german friend. L graciously led me through the Philosophenweg (Philosopher's Walk) and taught me 
 the German word for bug (Käfer). We met a comically deshelved (one-eyed) man in the marktplatz who was selling old newspapers and his own paintings. I bring this up because if 
 there was ever a character worth commiting to text, it was him. During the hour that he talked with us he had to run off twice to retrieve prints and at one point his STRAW HAT that had blown
 away. He asked me if I wanted his card at one point and I accepted, thinking it would be a quick business card transaction. Actually, he took out a post card and began writing his name (Beppo), 
 email, phone number, and then giving me an unending list of media recommendations beginning with the name of the french art dealer 'Ambroise Vollard', and ending with his favorite NPR 
 tiny desk concerts. During this music discussion it was discovered that we had actually both been at the same jazz club last Tuesday for the open jam session, so that bound us in a 
 very quaint and special way. As much as he talked, I'm very much hoping to see him there again tomorrow. Some characters just write themselves.  
<br> <br>
- Yesterday Q and E travelled with me to Stuttgart for the Frühlingsfest (spring festival). I think we were all expecting some sort of flower-filled street fair with spring 
baskets carefully crafted by local artists. Actually it was a carnival, with a slight Vegas theme. However—for reasons that I probably need to explore more in therapy—I felt 
great the whole day. It was like living without anxiety, and feeling consistently at peace with the world around me. I caught myself just feeling content, and in the mood that makes me say that 
everything feels like a dream. If I had a bullet journal, yesterday's square would have been bright green. Maybe someday I'll be able to isolate the steps to that feeling, but for now I'm 
just happy to feel it.

<br>We made it to entry 2! <br> Today has been a day, I've drank a lot of coffee and ventured to the store for brezeln (pretzels) and a bag of mixed wafer cookies that turned out to be 
delicious. I've been enjoying trying new food here, since I have a tendency to only eat my 15 safe foods back in 'the states'. I think for my second entry I want to have a 
take, just to start exploring the range of expression a blog can provide. I have a <strong> lot </strong> of ideas for my site, and more occuring by the day. Yesterday
I entertained having a page dedicated to the bugs I find, and today I realized that I could create a page where I review every forensic files episode that I watch. The concept
of having a highly niche passion that no other person cares about or engages with is in a word, exquisite. I think that may be true passion and perhaps even 
what it means to be human. All that to say, my take is actually about LA musicians. If Seattle is grunge, LA is jazz flute. I think that's all I have to say for the moment.

<br>Welcome to my world, <br>
I've wanted to make my own website for a long time. One of my favorite authors has a website that she writes on every day, she even publishes a book every 
few years with the entries. I have two of her books, and I like that some days she writes multiple pages and other days she writes a single word, or just a title. 
I've been inside a lot the last two days, but it's felt nice. I can finally make a place to put my thoughts, and I like that it's completely mine. I also enjoy the
format of writing within Visual Studio Code; it makes my words come out in pretty colors and tries to autocorrect my poetry with programming commands. I've been 
trying for years to find the perfect notebook or format to make myself write. I'm sure this isn't it, but I like it for now. 
<br>
Today I woke up late and spent a few hours adjusting the site. I've been so pleased with how all of the coding has turned out. I know it isn't perfect,
and I think I'm doing a few things wrong, but I feel like it looks authentic to how I wanted it, and how often does that happen? Eventually I got on the 
bus and bought some household items (can opener, thread, notebooks) and even found some leather pants that have been on my list. All was going exactly to plan
until I got on the wrong bus going home and ended up seeing a bit more of the city than I had wanted. That's mostly how my days go here, I sit on the bus and 
think, or try and listen to the other passengers and identify the words on posters and billboards. It's lonely, and pleasant, and different for me. 
I didn't eat great today, better luck tomorrow.
