<pre><b> 
German meadows and the house my mother lived in </b>

I have nothing to say
about the pearly castle gates
or the golden figures
carved in the cobblestone

I know I should record it all
and spot every difference 
and dry every flower 
to hold these days as the best 
I'll ever have

But all that comes to mind 
is the house my mother lived in
when she was 22
and nothing like me

the house she never told me about
but that I imagine 
sloped down with black siding
that fell coldest
when night came.

The house where she made dinner 
before she knew my favorite meal
with only the white kitchen light 
shining weakly
through the curtains.

    4.21.2022 </b>
    When I used to write some things came easy
    writing about you, for instance
    imagining you felt like digging my nail
    into my palm, or deciding 
    I wouldn't eat 
    Writing about you felt important
    and I didn't run out of it
    it spilled and curdled and moved me
    and I thought it would always come
    until far under my gaze
    in the back of the cellar where I kept the words
    the soft pink text fell apart
    became sticky in my fingers
    until there were no words at all
    and today I'm not even sure,
    which you you are anymore.
