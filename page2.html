<strong>Grow Up And Blow Away</strong>

she descends into her desperate longing  
always secretly, in the quiet after a meal 
when the clock strikes and the house grows 
larger and quicker into collapse 
splayed on the mattress, the weary lamps of 
of her childhood, shining altar candles in the dark.
she goes to the place they blow away to,

the sea of office windows forming the sun,
shapes and colors standing ever harsh,   
high purple accelerating off blocks of shadow,
the afternoon reprieve, where I hopped the fence 
with dad, to find the rotting railway car
fields matted and melted, dead mice in the grass.

the ones who made it-
placing themselves in cracking pastel balconies 
smoking in the morning, they are not found 
waking and forgetting, vision fraying at the edges 
looking out at the horizon and seeing only empty color
street lights fading forever into that great loneliness   
they are cruel, they are serene.

And now I am there, and how like those 
dreams it feels. 
















































        <strong>Grandma's House</strong>
        <pre>
    Lonely rooms in my grandmother's house 
    on the street I never learned the name of
    her carpet stretched too tight 
    run thin from her vaccuum, desperate to show  
    the lifetime of her busy hands
    
    Now when I come, I notice the striped lillies outside  
    - she gets to the door so slowly these days -
    straining in her bright white sneakers 
    placing her face carefully, eyes too wide  
    in sockets surgically sloped to keep 
    her here, tethered inside molded skin    
    
    'have a seat on the davenport'
    the house is shreiking, silent silent silent 
    bare but for the stately, wood frame 
    - the photo of her family, her everything 
    swallowing us in american glory 
    blood hung up forever on her wall.
    
    I'm sitting obediently on the davenport - waiting 
    staring as ever at the lamp above her chair 
    the only personality in this washed-out house 
    a 1950's sun orb, or maybe it's a moon,
    how'd something so beautiful sneak in here?
    shining shadows on Kirk, haphazard in his chair 
    
    Maybe it was me, not you, who slipped away 
    when you use to read me the secret garden, 
    and I pictured escaping this stale house.
    Maybe it was me, not you, who let us down,
    when this house with no story made me, 
    and I never liked to come.

            Things That Mean Nothing: 
            that a single pink PEZ is abandoned on floor of the train 
            that someone had to catch me by my backpack 
            because I tripped when the train started     
            that someone else showed everyone photos of his grandkid 
            that it's my favorite time of day and I didn't tell anyone  
    
            A Few More Things That Mean Nothing:
            that I feel like a boy sometimes when I see myself in store windows  
            that ants build mounds to live in when they could also just live alone 
            that someone else is probably thinking this same word right now  
    
            Even More Things That I Know Carry No Meaning:
            that dad used to take me to the united retals parking lot
            at this time of day, after martial arts   
            I went to sit in a parking lot off 82nd last year 
            just to watch the neighbor man smoke on his balcony 
            I used to deliver take out to people when I had nothing to do 
            I sometimes delivered to the same address twice 
            I've never made an interactive community-based art installation 
            I lose my grasp sometimes 
    
            The Most Important Things That Mean Nothing:
            that living sometimes reminds me of the drive down to Seattle 
            for my annual piano recital
            that nobody is looking at me 
            that I actually probably know why ants live in mounds

    Meeting new people </strong>

    Entering your room
    posters scraped and taped to the walls
    light misting it all through pink curtains
    books stacked low, piled like treasure
    you tell me you make music here
    speak with your friends in the morning
    you show me your collection
    of the sounds of waves crashing.

    You tell me about the parties here
    when this room is filled, crushing
    a mass caught in the sound
    vibrating out into the dead night
    ringing heavy through the streets

    Your shirts are hung on the walls
    cold sweat soaked into the threads
    they carried your body moment to moment
    protecting you, collecting dirt in the fabric
    There's echos of those nights,
    when you caught the sounds of waves crashing,
    and gave them away.

    Will any of me be left here?
    soaked in your walls, to be felt by someone
    tripping, heaving, too far gone
    I'm sorry I went quiet,
    and left your perfect apartment.
    But what could I ever say
    in this room sopped in your memories  
    worth hearing?

        <strong>Bar Night</strong> <br> 
        Walking red through the desert, 
        feeling so human,
        dirty snake boots, kicking and screaming, 
        bawling home from the bar, 
        sick in the head, greasy thoughts stuck, 
        slimy in the ears, sucker in the moonlight, 
        hollow in the sand, on and on and on, 
        smirking at the bouncer, who are you anymore?
        Snake bites tearing skin from skin, infection spreading, 
        rocks and bits of everything, strewn over 
        these mountains (step by step) 
        melting, boiling, recombining, 
        but somehow staying - in the rhythm of it all.

        <strong>Small Talk</strong>
        
        We've only just met 
        suddenly you are hearing me 
        we stay in the lines 
        I use my dowsing rod, prodding for warm water
        
        'yes, yes' my vocal tics 
        a dripping bathroom faucet 
        I'm pursing my lip, left eye blinking twice too many 
        like a shutter in the wind
        
        imagine if you reveled in my nervousness
        kissed me and said 'you're unpalatable'
        screamed when I told you what I do for work
        and throttled us both in sweaty arms
        
        please believe I wasn't always this way
        I've only newly forgotten
        what we say to each other 
        
        I remember when I knew what to do
        talking like finding strawberries in the garden 
        talking like small town neighbors 
        a gooey drawl, molasses 
        
        I wish we spoke in that dialect 
        that when you saw my eye flicker
        you thought of your mother 
        flustered in line at the grocery store.

    <pre>          
        You looked so wrong here, cowboy. 
        tumbling through the padded streets 
        a sorry sight, frail like the purple thistles. 
        You looked out at us 
        brow furrowed while you poked behind 
        our brittle storefronts, 
        guarding us from that overwhelming arch 
        of piercing sky.
        
        I can see the cracks here too, cowboy.
        Before you rode in, head up,
        sick wrists steady on the reins, 
        that secret you kept 
        jangling softly inside your pocket.
        Rode into this town where 
        we huddled in our moonlit cellars, 
        whiskey spilling down our sides, 
        our fingernails pressing crescents in the wood,  
        laughing and rolling over ourselves, 
        falling in flimsy carelessness, 
        nipping each other to the bone, 
        I know what we look like, cowboy. 
        
        Still you came down from those heavenly mountains, 
        towering walls of rock like the earth was caving in. 
        You crept lonely through the desert.
        You thought I wouldn't see you,
        strung up outside my house,
        crooked bones holding your body sour, 
        shoulders twisted and broken, 
        like a picture frame slipping down the wall. 
        
        You didn't want to leave us, did you cowboy?
        You'll miss our chicken shit sayings, 
        the bloody squealing of our gears, 
        as we fallow the rocks, gritting our teeth. 
        
        But you're still out for it -  
        scattering yourself as you walk 
        What was that in your pocket?
        ticking slow, your hand always resting 
        just inside the seam, remembering
        Who put it there so tightly?
        That you would limp your 
        butterfly shoulders brown and blue, 
        swing them free to the orange doldrums 
        kiss a million just like me,
        before you let it go?

            things I hold close, carry, extensions of me

            my disorders, my therapy, every story I've ever learned 
            my clothes (cotton, corduroy, wool, plastic)
                    cut and stitched, covering me 
                    safe in their thin grasp 
            my ring, found outside the Cheerful Tortoise on Jackson Avenue 
                    a third eye that never blinks, my protector 
            my trash I should remove, bottles ready to be redeemed 
                    but for now I let them stay
            my morning coffee, my addictions, my mistakes, my memories of my mother
            my bills, my bank statements shoved in the green folder sent from my insurance 
                    that treasured subscription
            the bee flying in my window
            the dust mites in my hair 
            my honesty, my bravery, my love for Max
            my thoughts of buying flowers 
            my avoidance of the mirror

    My feelings for you </strong>

    When I used to write some things came easy
    writing about you, for instance.
    Imagining you felt good in my mouth
    like sour candy.
    Daydreaming tore my stomach,
    a headrush like holding your breath,
    or choosing not to eat.
    
    Writing about you felt important
    and it never seemed to run dry
    it spilled out, curdled and kept coming
    and I thought it would always come.
    until far under my gaze
    in the back of the cellar where I kept it
    the soft pink text fell apart
    became sticky in my fingers
    until there were no words at all
    and today I'm not even sure,
    which you you are anymore.

            I would have gone so gladly

            burning through me   
            I know you're gone but maybe     
            still here enough to change me  
            Just help me let you leave

            Cracks on the sidewalk are
            the stripes on your backbone
            I still haven't eaten 
            I'll get a tattoo 
            a coiled centipede - I beg you 
            How does it look on me?
            
            Just let me up there!
            Where the buildings are broken
            I'd worm through walls
            Drown in cold voltaic seas
            Let me see the night collapse 
            and crash with you on concrete
            
            I'd be anything you need
            Brand the stamp right into me 
            Can't you see I'm sideways?
            take me any way you please
            Didn't you see I'm hovering? 
            Going would have came so easy
            
            I know I left myself behind 
            Why'd you have to say something? 
            I know I didn't make the train
            but I wanted to so badly 
            Going would have came so easy

            when night came.
            
            The house where she made dinner 
            before she knew my favorite meal
            with only the white kitchen light 
            shining weakly
            through the curtains.

    <strong>working on colors</strong>
    
    clocktower - coal black
    the sky behind you cools to that murky blue 
    expanse - the color that never softens
    as I get older 
    the color of the sky above the campfire 
    stars blinking cold as we drove over 
    the final stretch of gravel road 
    but there's something else on you - clocktower
    a new color to remember
    the way the setting sunlight clings to you
    orange seeping down your side 
    deep purple bricks dripping
    peach pie.

Alex </strong>
        
It beckons me in 
his smell on the wind 
I call him back to me
                
I want to catch up 
make my skin rough 
make my mouth a jagged grin
         
Call me Alex (Chris)
I scramble the cliff 
I sleep under stars at night
        
I fuck the men 
who look like him
                
they never notice 
I'm just like them
only searching and searching and searching.

            The man who cut my hair
            left it looking full, delicate
            a poised brown ball
            cut to my chin  
                                
            Little could he know 
            I would stand naked in my mirror
            pulling at strands
            placing them ragged
                                
            Using these thin threads
            to see myself clearer
            to make my body fall in line
            my sides straighten, like rulers
                                
            that I would use it 
            to manhandle,
            bend myself into place
            the way I know I am.
