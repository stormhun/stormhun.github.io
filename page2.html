<strong>Small Talk</strong>

We've only just met 
suddenly you are hearing me 
we stay in the lines 
I use my dowsing rod, prodding for warm water

'yes, yes' my vocal tics 
a dripping bathroom faucet 
I'm pursing my lip, left eye blinking twice too many 
like a shutter in the wind

imagine if you reveled in my nervousness
kissed me and said 'you're unpalatable'
screamed when I told you what I do for work
and throttled us both in sweaty arms

please believe I wasn't always this way
I've only newly forgotten
what we say to each other 

I remember when I knew what to do
talking like finding strawberries in the garden 
talking like small town neighbors 
a gooey drawl, molasses 

I wish we spoke in that dialect 
that when you saw my eye flicker
you thought of your mother 
flustered in line at the grocery store.

    Meeting new people </strong>

    Entering your room
    posters scraped and taped to the walls
    sunlight misting it all through pink curtains
    books stacked low, piled like treasure
    you tell me you make music here
    speak with your friends in the morning
    you show me your collection
    of the sounds of waves crashing.

    You tell me about the parties here
    when this room is filled, crushing
    a mass caught in the sound
    vibrating out into the dead night
    ringing heavy through the streets

    Your shirts are hung on the walls
    cold sweat soaked into the threads
    they carried your body moment to moment
    protecting you, collecting dirt in the fabric
    There's echos of those nights,
    when you caught the sounds of waves crashing,
    and gave them away.

    Will any of me be left here?
    soaked in your walls, to be felt by someone
    tripping, heaving, too far gone
    I'm sorry I went quiet,
    and left your perfect apartment.
    But what could I ever say
    in this room sopped in your memories  
    worth hearing?

April 26. 2022</strong>
                    
The man who cut my hair
left it looking full, delicate
a poised brown ball
cut to my chin  
                    
Little could he know 
I would stand naked in my mirror
pulling at strands
placing them ragged
                    
Using these thin threads
to see myself clearer
to make my body fall in line
my sides straighten, like rulers
                    
that I would use it 
to manhandle,
bend myself into place
the way I know I am.

Alex </strong>
            
It beckons me in 
his smell on the wind 
I call him back to me
                    
I want to catch up 
make my skin rough 
make my mouth a jagged grin
             
Call me Alex (Chris)
I scramble the cliff 
I sleep under stars at night
            
I fuck the men 
who look like him
                    
they never notice 
I'm just like them
only searching and searching and searching.

    My feelings for you </strong>

    When I used to write some things came easy
    writing about you, for instance.
    Imagining you felt good in my mouth
    like sour candy.
    Daydreaming tore my stomach,
    a headrush like holding your breath,
    or choosing not to eat.
    
    Writing about you felt important
    and it never seemed to run dry
    it spilled out, curdled and kept coming
    and I thought it would always come.
    until far under my gaze
    in the back of the cellar where I kept it
    the soft pink text fell apart
    became sticky in my fingers
    until there were no words at all
    and today I'm not even sure,
    which you you are anymore.

            In German Meadows </b>
            
            I have nothing to say
            about castle gates
            or golden figures
            carved in the cobblestone.
            
            I know I should record it all
            spot every difference 
            dry every flower 
            to hold these days as the best 
            I'll ever have.
            
            But all that comes to mind 
            is the house my mother lived in
            when she was 22
            and nothing like me.
            
            The house she never told me about
            but that I imagine 
            sloped down with black siding
            that fell coldest
            when night came.
            
            The house where she made dinner 
            before she knew my favorite meal
            with only the white kitchen light 
            shining weakly
            through the curtains.
