the sky has darkened now as you are no longer in the city - the night sky because you are running 
and running in the pitch black night with only the sliver of yellow moon behind you. 
<br><br>
its not pain that you feel or happiness or sadness or love or longing but really the discomfort of 
your body and the ground and the air - with perhaps excitement because it is night and you are alone. perhaps there are thoughts 
running too - you have looked up at the new bend in the trees and realized you are somewhere else. How 
did you go so far without remembering? 
<br><br>
you are in the next town now, leaving the darkest stretch of road and the streetlights are here again, the sky is blue now, 
the houses are lit even up on the hills. empty streets so you can run in the center, but the trees by the sidewalk on the riverbank 
hold fireflies. you are so thirsty now and there is no water, you haven't even turned around so it will be ages until you have 
water, so you are desperate. 
<br><br>
on the bank by the trees with the fireflies is a building, hard lines and unknown contents. on the side of the building a door is 
open, light seeping into the parking lot and it looks so flimsy, all of it. the wall of the building looks as small as cardboard, 
the white florescence around the door is dull, washed out against the streetlights. but you were looking for water, you are so 
thirsty. 
<br><br>
You go to the door and inside is a grey room, the kind you expected - tile floors, halogen light overhead. you tread careful 
here. you go to the desk and rifle through the drawer, there is no sound but the passing of the papers, the hooks of your fingers, 
and here is where you start remembering -

Self Portrait (July 13, 2022)
<br><br>
I sit, I stand, I think of you.
I sit, I stand, I think of you. 
<br><br>
splayed out sticks flung from the basket 
arms so long they reach you 
arms so long they get thin 
<br><br>
walking over bridges and theres that searing 
achy - brakey wallowing as if I might do it. 
always for you, it's always for you.
<br><br>
I saw the girl from that earring poem today,
strung up on a fire escape, like a cat 
she looked at the camera and dangled over 
a long silver ribbon that
made me think of a silver fish. 
<br><br>
You wan't to know me? 
You'll need to know everyone else first.
her silver tongue, his dagger earrings 
I'm telling you I'm really nothing  
but predictable.

<br>you really get to me sometimes, ya know?
<br><br>
<br>I saw the girl from that earring poem today,

<br>she looked at the camera and dangled over 
<br>a long shiny tail that
<br>I'm sure someday I'll describe 
<br>as looking like a silverfish 
<br><br>
<br>If I'm honest with you,
<br>this poem was supposed to be about me.
<br><br> 
<br>But I guess I'm really up to nothing,  
<br>Except waiting for your move 
<br><br>

<br><br>
<br>You wear a silver chain 
<br>I wear a gold chain
<br>when you fuck me your chain falls 
<br>into my open mouth and I taste 
<br>your bloody steel lust 
<br><br>
<br>When I fuck you it's my chain 
<br>that bounces 
<br>your eyes stay on my chain 
<br>just enough metal for armor  
<br>candle light reflects only from metal 
<br>making us mirrors 
<br><br> 
<br>My chain is braided like hair 
<br>from my mother 
<br>Chains are just very in right now 
<br>and she was getting rid of it 
<br>I definitely don't think of her 
<br>when our chains cross paths 
<br>and you hold me through the night

        <br>
        <br>Golden words from time vorbei 
        <br>fall in crowns atop my bowing head 
        <br>I let the song of yesteryear revive
        <br>fertile valleys long since dead. 
        <br>
        <br>Oh sweet glimmering morning! 
        <br>Oh nightly clouds that ev'r clear!
        <br>today bestoys Heidelbergs' sweet father -
        <br>Joseph von Eichendorff is here! 
        <br>
        <br>I kneel before the sodden lyrics 
        <br>lead his Knights and Nixen to my core 
        <br>let red mouths kiss my mild neck
        <br>and flowing Jungfraus paint my shore.
        <br>
        <br>But halt schön Eichendorff
        <br>sweet nightengale you've ceased to sing!
        <br>I'm afraid my head has slipped away

        <br>
        <br>I promise you I wishe I heard

        <br>
        <br>Eichendorff calls out in urgence 
        <br>notes breaking through the crashing waves 
        <br>I'm deaf but for the lucid flower 
        <br>of their breathing yesterday. 
    <br>
    <br>It took until the final line -

    <br>when he is only caught in dreamy air?

            Things That Mean Nothing: 
            that a single pink PEZ is abandoned on floor of the train 
            that someone had to catch me by my backpack 
            because I tripped when the train started     
            that someone else showed everyone photos of his grandkid 
            that it's my favorite time of day and I didn't tell anyone  
    
            A Few More Things That Mean Nothing:
            that I feel like a boy sometimes when I see myself in store windows  
            that ants build mounds to live in when they could also just live alone 
            that someone else is probably thinking this same word right now  
    
            Even More Things That I Know Carry No Meaning:
            that dad used to take me to the united retals parking lot
            at this time of day, after martial arts   
            I went to sit in a parking lot off 82nd last year 
            just to watch the neighbor man smoke on his balcony 
            I used to deliver take out to people when I had nothing to do 
            I sometimes delivered to the same address twice 
            I've never made an interactive community-based art installation 
            I lose my grasp sometimes 
    
            The Most Important Things That Mean Nothing:
            that living sometimes reminds me of the drive down to Seattle 
            for my annual piano recital
            that nobody is looking at me 
            that I actually probably know why ants live in mounds

            Instructions:
            <br>
            <br>I dare you to tie it all back 
            <br>to your favorite things 
            <br>to not write to them 
            <br>but to write to yourself 
            <br>
            <br>lay mellow on the grass 
            <br>pick a flower for them 
            <br>to forget when you leave 
            <br>
            <br>focus on the unremarkable summer evening 
            <br>when you ate burgers and rice 
            <br>and looked out the kitchen window 
            <br>light falling in and the walls 
            <br>turning amber, wooden cabinets with 
            <br>broken hinges - hoping to finish in time 
            <br>to look for beetles before dark 
            <br>
            <br>much ado about you 
            <br>on and on about myself 
            <br>always turning the mirror around 
            <br>fallow light lingers here 
            <br>let it cool and walk on 
            <br>take a pinch between your fingers 
            <br>and let it fall onto your tongue

    Meeting new people </strong>

    Entering your room
    posters scraped and taped to the walls
    light misting it all through pink curtains
    books stacked low, piled like treasure
    you tell me you make music here
    speak with your friends in the morning
    you show me your collection
    of the sounds of waves crashing.

    You tell me about the parties here
    when this room is filled, crushing
    a mass caught in the sound
    vibrating out into the dead night
    ringing heavy through the streets

    Your shirts are hung on the walls
    cold sweat soaked into the threads
    they carried your body moment to moment
    protecting you, collecting dirt in the fabric
    There's echos of those nights,
    when you caught the sounds of waves crashing,
    and gave them away.

    Will any of me be left here?
    soaked in your walls, to be felt by someone
    tripping, heaving, too far gone
    I'm sorry I went quiet,
    and left your perfect apartment.
    But what could I ever say
    in this room sopped in your memories  
    worth hearing?

        Walking red through the desert, 
        feeling so human,
        dirty snake boots, kicking and screaming, 
        bawling home from the bar, 
        sick in the head, greasy thoughts stuck, 
        slimy in the ears, sucker in the moonlight, 
        hollow in the sand, on and on and on, 
        smirking at the bouncer, who are you anymore?
        Snake bites tearing skin from skin, infection spreading, 
        rocks and bits of everything, strewn over 
        these mountains (step by step) 
        melting, boiling, recombining, 
        but somehow staying - in the rhythm of it all.

        <strong>Small Talk</strong>
        
        We've only just met 
        suddenly you are hearing me 
        we stay in the lines 
        I use my dowsing rod, prodding for warm water
        
        'yes, yes' my vocal tics 
        a dripping bathroom faucet 
        I'm pursing my lip, left eye blinking twice too many 
        like a shutter in the wind
        
        imagine if you reveled in my nervousness
        kissed me and said 'you're unpalatable'
        screamed when I told you what I do for work
        and throttled us both in sweaty arms
        
        please believe I wasn't always this way
        I've only newly forgotten
        what we say to each other 
        
        I remember when I knew what to do
        talking like finding strawberries in the garden 
        talking like small town neighbors 
        a gooey drawl, molasses 
        
        I wish we spoke in that dialect 
        that when you saw my eye flicker
        you thought of your mother 
        flustered in line at the grocery store.

        You looked so wrong here, cowboy. 
        tumbling through the padded streets 
        a sorry sight, frail like the purple thistles. 
        You looked out at us 
        brow furrowed while you poked behind 
        our brittle storefronts, 
        guarding us from that overwhelming arch 
        of piercing sky.
        
        I can see the cracks here too, cowboy.
        Before you rode in, head up,
        sick wrists steady on the reins, 
        that secret you kept 
        jangling softly inside your pocket.
        Rode into this town where 
        we huddled in our moonlit cellars, 
        whiskey spilling down our sides, 
        our fingernails pressing crescents in the wood,  
        laughing and rolling over ourselves, 
        falling in flimsy carelessness, 
        nipping each other to the bone, 
        I know what we look like, cowboy. 
        
        Still you came down from those heavenly mountains, 
        towering walls of rock like the earth was caving in. 
        You crept lonely through the desert.
        You thought I wouldn't see you,
        strung up outside my house,
        crooked bones holding your body sour, 
        shoulders twisted and broken, 
        like a picture frame slipping down the wall. 
        
        You didn't want to leave us, did you cowboy?
        You'll miss our chicken shit sayings, 
        the bloody squealing of our gears, 
        as we fallow the rocks, gritting our teeth. 
        
        But you're still out for it -  
        scattering yourself as you walk 
        What was that in your pocket?
        ticking slow, your hand always resting 
        just inside the seam, remembering
        Who put it there so tightly?
        That you would limp your 
        butterfly shoulders brown and blue, 
        swing them free to the orange doldrums 
        kiss a million just like me,
        before you let it go?

                    safe in their thin grasp 
            my ring, found outside the Cheerful Tortoise on Jackson Avenue 
                    a third eye that never blinks, my protector 
            my trash I should remove, bottles ready to be redeemed 
                    but for now I let them stay
            my morning coffee, my addictions, my mistakes, my memories of my mother
            my bills, my bank statements shoved in the green folder sent from my insurance 
                    that treasured subscription
            the bee flying in my window
            the dust mites in my hair 
            my honesty, my bravery, my love for Max
            my thoughts of buying flowers 
            my avoidance of the mirror 
            Now tell me what things of mine 
            have fallen into your things too.

    My feelings for you </strong>

    When I used to write some things came easy
    writing about you, for instance.
    Imagining you felt good in my mouth
    like sour candy.
    Daydreaming tore my stomach,
    a headrush like holding your breath,
    or choosing not to eat.
    
    Writing about you felt important
    and it never seemed to run dry
    it spilled out, curdled and kept coming
    and I thought it would always come.
    until far under my gaze
    in the back of the cellar where I kept it
    the soft pink text fell apart
    became sticky in my fingers
    until there were no words at all
    and today I'm not even sure,
    which you you are anymore.

            <strong>Ascension Day (I'll See You In Berlin)</strong>
            
            I would have gone so gladly 
            the moments here are   
            burning through me   
            I know you're gone but maybe     
            still here enough to change me  
            Just help me let you leave

            Cracks on the sidewalk are
            the stripes on your backbone
            I still haven't eaten 
            I'll get a tattoo 
            a coiled centipede - I beg you 
            How does it look on me?
            
            Just let me up there!
            Where the buildings are broken
            I'd worm through walls
            Drown in cold voltaic seas
            Let me see the night collapse 
            and crash with you on concrete
            
            I'd be anything you need
            Brand the stamp right into me 
            Can't you see I'm sideways?
            take me any way you please
            Didn't you see I'm hovering? 
            Going would have came so easy
            
            I know I left myself behind 
            Why'd you have to say something? 
            I know I didn't make the train
            but I wanted to so badly 
            Going would have came so easy
            
            All you had to do was take me 

            What made you think I wasn't worthy?

            I have nothing to say
            about castle gates
            or golden figures
            carved in the cobblestone.
            
            I know I should record it all
            spot every difference 
            dry every flower 
            to hold these days as the best 
            I'll ever have.
            
            But all that comes to mind 
            is the house my mother lived in
            when she was 22
            and nothing like me.
            
            The house she never told me about
            but that I imagine 
            sloped down with black siding
            that fell coldest
            when night came.
            
            The house where she made dinner 
            before she knew my favorite meal
            with only the white kitchen light 
            shining weakly
            through the curtains.

    <strong>working on colors</strong>
    
    clocktower - coal black
    the sky behind you cools to that murky blue 
    expanse - the color that never softens
    as I get older 
    the color of the sky above the campfire 
    stars blinking cold as we drove over 
    the final stretch of gravel road 
    but there's something else on you - clocktower
    a new color to remember
    the way the setting sunlight clings to you
    orange seeping down your side 
    deep purple bricks dripping
    peach pie.

Alex </strong>
        
It beckons me in 
his smell on the wind 
I call him back to me
                
I want to catch up 
make my skin rough 
make my mouth a jagged grin
         
Call me Alex (Chris)
I scramble the cliff 
I sleep under stars at night
        
I fuck the men 
who look like him
                
they never notice 
I'm just like them
only searching and searching and searching.

            The man who cut my hair
            left it looking full, delicate
            a poised brown ball
            cut to my chin  
                                
            Little could he know 
            I would stand naked in my mirror
            pulling at strands
            placing them ragged
                                
            Using these thin threads
            to see myself clearer
            to make my body fall in line
            my sides straighten, like rulers
                                
            that I would use it 
            to manhandle,
            bend myself into place
            the way I know I am.
