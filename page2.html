<pre><b> 
German meadows and the house my mother lived in </b>

I have nothing to say
about the pearly castle gates
or the golden figures
carved in the cobblestone

I know I should record it all
and spot every difference 
and dry every flower 
to hold these days as the best 
I'll ever have

But all that comes to mind 
is the house my mother lived in
when she was 22
and nothing like me

the house she never told me about
but that I imagine 
sloped down with black siding
that fell coldest
when night came.

The house where she made dinner 
before she knew my favorite meal
with only the white kitchen light 
shining weakly
through the curtains.

<pre><b> 
    My feelings for you </b>

    When I used to write some things came easy
    writing about you, for instance.
    Imagining you felt good in my mouth
    like sour candy.
    Daydreaming tore my stomach,
    a headrush like holding your breath,
    or choosing not to eat.

    Writing about you felt important
    and it never seemed to run dry
    it spilled out, curdled and kept coming
    and I thought it would always come.
    until far under my gaze
    in the back of the cellar where I kept it
    the soft pink text fell apart
    became sticky in my fingers
    until there were no words at all
    and today I'm not even sure,
    which you you are anymore.
