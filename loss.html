            <pre>          
                You looked so wrong here, cowboy. 
                tumbling through the padded streets 
                a sorry sight, frail like the purple thistles. 
                You looked out at us 
                brow furrowed while you poked behind 
                our brittle storefronts, 
                guarding us from that overwhelming arch 
                of piercing sky.
                
                I can see the cracks here too, cowboy.
                Before you rode in, head up,
                sick wrists steady on the reins, 
                that secret you kept 
                jangling softly inside your pocket.
                Rode into this town where 
                we huddled in our moonlit cellars, 
                whiskey spilling down our sides, 
                our fingernails pressing crescents in the wood,  
                laughing and rolling over ourselves, 
                falling in flimsy carelessness, 
                nipping each other to the bone, 
                I know what we look like, cowboy. 
                
                Still you came down from those heavenly mountains, 
                towering walls of rock like the earth was caving in. 
                You crept lonely through the desert.
                You thought I wouldn't see you,
                strung up outside my house,
                crooked bones holding your body sour, 
                shoulders twisted and broken, 
                like a picture frame slipping down the wall. 
                
                You didn't want to leave us, did you cowboy?
                You'll miss our chicken shit sayings, 
                the bloody squealing of our gears, 
                as we fallow the rocks, gritting our teeth. 
                
                But you're still out for it -  
                scattering yourself as you walk 
                What was that in your pocket?
                ticking slow, your hand always resting 
                just inside the seam, remembering
                Who put it there so tightly?
                That you would limp your 
                butterfly shoulders brown and blue, 
                swing them free to the orange doldrums 
                kiss a million just like me,
                before you let it go? 
                 </pre>

    <strong>Grandma's House</strong>

    Lonely rooms in my grandmother's house 
    on the street I never learned the name of
    her carpet stretched too tight 
    run thin from her vaccuum, desperate to show  
    the lifetime of her busy hands
    
    Now when I come, I notice the striped lillies outside  
    - she gets to the door so slowly these days -
    straining in her bright white sneakers 
    placing her face carefully, eyes too wide  
    in sockets surgically sloped to keep 
    her here, tethered inside molded skin    
    
    'have a seat on the davenport'
    the house is shreiking, silent silent silent 
    bare but for the stately, wood frame 
    - the photo of her family, her everything 
    swallowing us in american glory 
    blood hung up forever on her wall.
    
    I'm sitting obediently on the davenport - waiting 
    staring as ever at the lamp above her chair 
    the only personality in this washed-out house 
    a 1950's sun orb, or maybe it's a moon,
    how'd something so beautiful sneak in here?
    shining shadows on Kirk, haphazard in his chair 
    
    Maybe it was me, not you, who slipped away 
    when you use to read me the secret garden, 
    and I pictured escaping this stale house.
    Maybe it was me, not you, who let us down,
    when this house with no story made me, 
    and I never liked to come.
