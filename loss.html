            <br>You looked so wrong here, cowboy. 
            <br>tumbling through the padded streets 
            <br>a sorry sight, frail like the purple thistles. 
            <br>You looked out at us 
            <br>brow furrowed while you poked behind 
            <br>our brittle storefronts, 
            <br>guarding us from that overwhelming arch 
            <br>of piercing sky.
               <br> 
            <br>I can see the cracks here too, cowboy.
            <br>Before you rode in, head up,
            <br>sick wrists steady on the reins, 
            <br>that secret you kept 
            <br>jangling softly inside your pocket.
            <br>Rode into this town where 
            <br>we huddled in our moonlit cellars, 
            <br>whiskey spilling down our sides, 
            <br>our fingernails pressing crescents in the wood,  
            <br>laughing and rolling over ourselves, 
            <br>falling in flimsy carelessness, 
            <br>nipping each other to the bone, 
            <br>I know what we look like, cowboy. 
            <br>
            <br>Still you came down from those heavenly mountains, 
            <br>towering walls of rock like the earth was caving in. 
            <br>You crept lonely through the desert.
            <br>You thought I wouldn't see you,
            <br>strung up outside my house,
            <br>crooked bones holding your body sour, 
            <br>shoulders twisted and broken, 
            <br>like a picture frame slipping down the wall. 
            <br> 
            <br>You didn't want to leave us, did you cowboy?
            <br>You'll miss our chicken shit sayings, 
            <br>the bloody squealing of our gears, 
            <br>as we fallow the rocks, gritting our teeth. 
            <br> 
            <br>But you're still out for it -  
            <br>scattering yourself as you walk 
            <br>What was that in your pocket?
            <br>ticking slow, your hand always resting 
            <br>just inside the seam, remembering
            <br>Who put it there so tightly?
            <br>That you would limp your 
            <br>butterfly shoulders brown and blue, 
            <br>swing them free to the orange doldrums 
            <br>kiss a million just like me,
            <br>before you let it go?

    <strong>Grandma's House</strong>
<br>
    <br>Lonely rooms in my grandmother's house 
    <br>on the street I never learned the name of
    <br>her carpet stretched too tight 
    <br>run thin from her vaccuum, desperate to show  
    <br>the lifetime of her busy hands
    <br>
    <br>Now when I come, I notice the striped lillies outside  
    <br>- she gets to the door so slowly these days -
    <br>straining in her bright white sneakers 
    <br>placing her face carefully, eyes too wide  
    <br>in sockets surgically sloped to keep 
    <br>her here, tethered inside molded skin    
    <br>
    <br>'have a seat on the davenport'
    <br>the house is shreiking, silent silent silent 
    <br>bare but for the stately, wood frame 
    <br>- the photo of her family, her everything 
    <br>swallowing us in american glory 
    <br>blood hung up forever on her wall.
    <br>
    <br>I'm sitting obediently on the davenport - waiting 
    <br>staring as ever at the lamp above her chair 
    <br>the only personality in this washed-out house 
    <br>a 1950's sun orb, or maybe it's a moon,
    <br>how'd something so beautiful sneak in here?
    <br>shining shadows on Kirk, haphazard in his chair 
    <br>
    <br>Maybe it was me, not you, who slipped away 
    <br>when you use to read me the secret garden, 
    <br>and I pictured escaping this stale house.
    <br>Maybe it was me, not you, who let us down,
    <br>when this house with no story made me, 
    <br>and I never liked to come.
