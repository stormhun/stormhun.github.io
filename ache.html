                <strong>Ascension Day (I'll See You In Berlin)</strong>
                
                I would have gone so gladly 
                the moments here are   
                burning through me   
                I know you're gone but maybe     
                still here enough to change me  
                Just help me let you leave
    
                Cracks on the sidewalk are
                the stripes on your backbone
                I still haven't eaten 
                I'll get a tattoo 
                a coiled centipede - I beg you 
                How does it look on me?
                
                Just let me up there!
                Where the buildings are broken
                I'd worm through walls
                Drown in cold voltaic seas
                Let me see the night collapse 
                and crash with you on concrete
                
                I'd be anything you need
                Brand the stamp right into me 
                Can't you see I'm sideways?
                take me any way you please
                Didn't you see I'm hovering? 
                Going would have came so easy
                
                I know I left myself behind 
                Why'd you have to say something? 
                I know I didn't make the train
                but I wanted to so badly 
                Going would have came so easy
                
                All you had to do was take me 
    
                What made you think I wasn't worthy?

    <strong>Small Talk</strong>
    
    We've only just met 
    suddenly you are hearing me 
    we stay in the lines 
    I use my dowsing rod, prodding for warm water
    
    'yes, yes' my vocal tics 
    a dripping bathroom faucet 
    I'm pursing my lip, left eye blinking twice too many 
    like a shutter in the wind
    
    imagine if you reveled in my nervousness
    kissed me and said 'you're unpalatable'
    screamed when I told you what I do for work
    and throttled us both in sweaty arms
    
    please believe I wasn't always this way
    I've only newly forgotten
    what we say to each other 
    
    I remember when I knew what to do
    talking like finding strawberries in the garden 
    talking like small town neighbors 
    a gooey drawl, molasses 
    
    I wish we spoke in that dialect 
    that when you saw my eye flicker
    you thought of your mother 
    flustered in line at the grocery store.
