                <strong>Ascension Day (I'll See You In Berlin)</strong>
<br>
                <br>I would have gone so gladly 
                <br>the moments here are   
                <br>burning through me   
                <br>I know you're gone but maybe     
                <br>still here enough to change me  
                <br>Just help me let you leave
    <br>
                <br>Cracks on the sidewalk are
                <br>the stripes on your backbone
                <br>I still haven't eaten 
                <br>I'll get a tattoo 
                <br>a coiled centipede - I beg you 
                <br>How does it look on me?
                <br>
                <br>Just let me up there!
                <br>Where the buildings are broken
                <br>I'd worm through walls
                <br>Drown in cold voltaic seas
                <br>Let me see the night collapse 
                <br>and crash with you on concrete
                <br>
                <br>I'd be anything you need
                <br>Brand the stamp right into me 
                <br>Can't you see I'm sideways?
                <br>take me any way you please
                <br>Didn't you see I'm hovering? 
                <br>Going would have came so easy
                <br>
                <br>I know I left myself behind 
                <br>Why'd you have to say something? 
                <br>I know I didn't make the train
                <br>but I wanted to so badly 
                <br>Going would have came so easy
                <br>
                <br>All you had to do was take me
                <br> 
                <br>What made you think I wasn't worthy?

    <strong>Small Talk</strong>
    <br>
    <br>We've only just met 
    <br>suddenly you are hearing me 
    <br>we stay in the lines 
    <br>I use my dowsing rod, prodding for warm water
    <br>
    <br>'yes, yes' my vocal tics 
    <br>a dripping bathroom faucet 
    <br>I'm pursing my lip, left eye blinking twice too many 
    <br>like a shutter in the wind
    <br>
    <br>imagine if you reveled in my nervousness
    <br>kissed me and said 'you're unpalatable'
    <br>screamed when I told you what I do for work
    <br>and throttled us both in sweaty arms
    <br>
    <br>please believe I wasn't always this way
    <br>I've only newly forgotten
    <br>what we say to each other 
    <br>
    <br>I remember when I knew what to do
    <br>talking like finding strawberries in the garden 
    <br>talking like small town neighbors 
    <br>a gooey drawl, molasses 
    <br>
    <br>I wish we spoke in that dialect 
    <br>that when you saw my eye flicker
    <br>you thought of your mother 
    <br>flustered in line at the grocery store.
