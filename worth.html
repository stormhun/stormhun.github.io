                <strong>My Collection</strong>
                <br>
                <br>Please see my clean room
                <br>I've just swept
                <br>let me show you the things I collect
                <br>things I hold close, carry, extensions of me 
                <br>things I fold myself into, neatly
                <br>ticket stubs in my scrapbook, perfect
                <br>clean little trinkets I string like beads across my body 
                <br>
                <br>my disorders, my therapy, every story I've ever learned 
                <br>my clothes (cotton, corduroy, wool, plastic)
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cut and stitched, covering me 
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;safe in their thin grasp 
                <br>my ring, found outside the Cheerful Tortoise on Jackson Avenue 
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a third eye that never blinks, my protector 
                <br>my trash I should remove, bottles ready to be redeemed 
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but for now I let them stay
                <br>my morning coffee, my addictions, my mistakes, my memories of my mother
                <br>my bills, my bank statements shoved in the green folder sent from my insurance 
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that treasured subscription
                <br>the bee flying in my window
                <br>the dust mites in my hair 
                <br>my honesty, my bravery, my love for Max
                <br>my thoughts of buying flowers 
                <br>my avoidance of the mirror 
                <br>Now tell me what things of mine 
                <br>have fallen into your things too.

<strong>
    Meeting new people </strong>
<br>
<br>Entering your room
<br>posters scraped and taped to the walls
<br>light misting it all through pink curtains
<br>books stacked low, piled like treasure
<br>you tell me you make music here
<br>speak with your friends in the morning
<br>you show me your collection
<br>of the sounds of waves crashing.
<br>
<br>You tell me about the parties here
<br>when this room is filled, crushing
<br>a mass caught in the sound
<br>vibrating out into the dead night
<br>ringing heavy through the streets
<br>
<br>Your shirts are hung on the walls
<br>cold sweat soaked into the threads
<br>they carried your body moment to moment
<br>protecting you, collecting dirt in the fabric
<br>There's echos of those nights,
<br>when you caught the sounds of waves crashing,
<br>and gave them away.
<br>
<br>Will any of me be left here?
<br>soaked in your walls, to be felt by someone
<br>tripping, heaving, too far gone
<br>I'm sorry I went quiet,
<br>and left your perfect apartment.
<br>But what could I ever say
<br>in this room sopped in your memories  
<br>worth hearing?
