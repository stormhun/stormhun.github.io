                <strong>My Collection</strong>

                Please see my clean room
                I've just swept
                let me show you the things I collect
                things I hold close, carry, extensions of me 
                things I fold myself into, neatly
                ticket stubs in my scrapbook, perfect
                clean little trinkets I string like beads across my body 
                
                my disorders, my therapy, every story I've ever learned 
                my clothes (cotton, corduroy, wool, plastic)
                        cut and stitched, covering me 
                        safe in their thin grasp 
                my ring, found outside the Cheerful Tortoise on Jackson Avenue 
                        a third eye that never blinks, my protector 
                my trash I should remove, bottles ready to be redeemed 
                        but for now I let them stay
                my morning coffee, my addictions, my mistakes, my memories of my mother
                my bills, my bank statements shoved in the green folder sent from my insurance 
                        that treasured subscription
                the bee flying in my window
                the dust mites in my hair 
                my honesty, my bravery, my love for Max
                my thoughts of buying flowers 
                my avoidance of the mirror 
                Now tell me what things of mine 
                have fallen into your things too.

    Meeting new people </strong>

    Entering your room
    posters scraped and taped to the walls
    light misting it all through pink curtains
    books stacked low, piled like treasure
    you tell me you make music here
    speak with your friends in the morning
    you show me your collection
    of the sounds of waves crashing.

    You tell me about the parties here
    when this room is filled, crushing
    a mass caught in the sound
    vibrating out into the dead night
    ringing heavy through the streets

    Your shirts are hung on the walls
    cold sweat soaked into the threads
    they carried your body moment to moment
    protecting you, collecting dirt in the fabric
    There's echos of those nights,
    when you caught the sounds of waves crashing,
    and gave them away.

    Will any of me be left here?
    soaked in your walls, to be felt by someone
    tripping, heaving, too far gone
    I'm sorry I went quiet,
    and left your perfect apartment.
    But what could I ever say
    in this room sopped in your memories  
    worth hearing?
