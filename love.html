            <strong>Grow Up And Blow Away</strong>
<br>
<br>she flies into desperate longing 
<br>secretly, in the quiet after a meal 
<br>when the clock strikes and the house grows 
<br>larger and quicker into the collapse of night
<br>splayed on the mattress, the weary lamps  
<br>from her childhood, like altar candles in the dark.
<br>she goes to the place she always does:
<br>
<br>the sea of office windows form the rising sun,
<br>shapes and colors standing harsh and barren,   
<br>high purple accelerating on blocks of shadow,
<br>the afternoon reprieve, where I hopped the fence 
<br>with dad, to find the rotting railway car
<br>fields matted and melted, dead mice in the grass.
<br>
<br>the ones who made it-
<br>placing themselves in cracking pastel balconies 
<br>smoking in the morning, they are not found 
<br>waking and forgetting, vision fraying at the edges 
<br>looking out at the horizon and seeing only empty color
<br>street lights fading forever into that great loneliness   
<br>they are cruel, they are serene.
<br>
<br>And now I am there, and how rare and how excruciating 
<br>it feels to find it exactly as I hoped. 
<br>
<br>

 <strong>The Lot (Mannheim)</strong><br>
            <br>suddenly my path 
            <br>is only stretching blocks of concrete 
            <br>a space too big for using  
            <br>afternoon sun careening off 
            <br>sending warm red ripples my way 
            <br>the edges too bounded 
            <br>brushed in weeds and rotting cars 
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>one lonely bicycle 
            <br>is speeding towards the beating center 
            <br>her dad is lingering 
            <br> at the edge with me 
            <br>we both sense the danger 
            <br>of this too human expanse 
            <br>holding us up in cracked hands 
            <br>offering us into a bleeding sky
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

                <strong>working on colors</strong>
                <br>
                <br>clocktower - coal black
                <br>the sky behind you cools to that murky blue 
                <br>expanse - the color that never softens
                <br>as I get older 
                <br>the color of the sky above the campfire 
                <br>stars blinking cold as we drove over 
                <br>the final stretch of gravel road 
                <br>but there's something else on you - clocktower
                <br>a new color to remember
                <br>the way the setting sunlight clings to you
                <br>orange seeping down your side 
                <br>deep purple bricks dripping
                <br>peach pie.  
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
