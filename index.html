Glass 
Description
Approximately 7x10x10 cm.
elliptical
Ca 300 ml holding capacity
Screw thread at the top (Lid not
present)

On the floor 
Barely beneath the edge of the bed 
touching the Carpet.
Framed through a hanger (wire
covered in rubber)
& synthetic fiber bag with cables 
(broken)

Content probably once Cherrys,
Lately water (wasting stains inside 
and out)

Relation:
Two indentical glasses are placed 
on the shelf above.
Optically identical, not in their 
relationship to the room 
(The observer does not know about the 
Relation to the room)
A trace from where you've been 
sitting 
carefree 
Between the two places 
where nobody should be sitting in 
my room. 
The fear lurks here around every 
corner 
In the Deep red of the carpet, in 
the dust 

Why right there?
It's quite a bad place to sit.

    <strong>What the Living Do</strong><br>
    <i>Marie Howe</i>
              <pre>  
    Johnny, the kitchen sink has been clogged for days, some utensil probably fell down there.
    And the Drano won't work but smells dangerous, and the crusty dishes have piled up
                
    waiting for the plumber I still haven't called. This is the everyday we spoke of.
    It's winter again: the sky's a deep, headstrong blue, and the sunlight pours through
                
    the open living-room windows because the heat's on too high in here and I can't turn it off.
    For weeks now, driving, or dropping a bag of groceries in the street, the bag breaking,
                
    I've been thinking: This is what the living do. And yesterday, hurrying along those
    wobbly bricks in the Cambridge sidewalk, spilling my coffee down my wrist and sleeve,
                
    I thought it again, and again later, when buying a hairbrush: This is it.
    Parking. Slamming the car door shut in the cold. What you called that yearning.
                
    What you finally gave up. We want the spring to come and the winter to pass. We want
    whoever to call or not call, a letter, a kiss—we want more and more and then more of it.
                
    But there are moments, walking, when I catch a glimpse of myself in the window glass,
    say, the window of the corner video store, and I'm gripped by a cherishing so deep
                
    for my own blowing hair, chapped face, and unbuttoned coat that I'm speechless:
    I am living. I remember you.
