    <strong>Saturday At The Canal</strong>
    <i>Gary Soto</i>

    I was hoping to be happy by seventeen.
    School was a sharp check mark in the roll book,
    An obnoxious tuba playing at noon because our team
    Was going to win at night. The teachers were
    Too close to dying to understand. The hallways
    Stank of poor grades and unwashed hair. Thus,
    A friend and I sat watching the water on Saturday,
    Neither of us talking much, just warming ourselves
    By hurling large rocks at the dusty ground
    And feeling awful because San Francisco was a postcard
    On a bedroom wall. We wanted to go there,
    Hitchhike under the last migrating birds
    And be with people who knew more than three chords
    On a guitar. We didn't drink or smoke,
    But our hair was shoulder length, wild when
    The wind picked up and the shadows of
    This loneliness gripped loose dirt. By bus or car,
    By the sway of train over a long bridge,
    We wanted to get out. The years froze
    As we sat on the bank. Our eyes followed the water,
    White-tipped but dark underneath, racing out of town.

    <strong>What the Living Do</strong><br>
    <i>Marie Howe</i>
              <pre>  
    Johnny, the kitchen sink has been clogged for days, some utensil probably fell down there.
    And the Drano won't work but smells dangerous, and the crusty dishes have piled up
                
    waiting for the plumber I still haven't called. This is the everyday we spoke of.
    It's winter again: the sky's a deep, headstrong blue, and the sunlight pours through
                
    the open living-room windows because the heat's on too high in here and I can't turn it off.
    For weeks now, driving, or dropping a bag of groceries in the street, the bag breaking,
                
    I've been thinking: This is what the living do. And yesterday, hurrying along those
    wobbly bricks in the Cambridge sidewalk, spilling my coffee down my wrist and sleeve,
                
    I thought it again, and again later, when buying a hairbrush: This is it.
    Parking. Slamming the car door shut in the cold. What you called that yearning.
                
    What you finally gave up. We want the spring to come and the winter to pass. We want
    whoever to call or not call, a letter, a kiss—we want more and more and then more of it.
                
    But there are moments, walking, when I catch a glimpse of myself in the window glass,
    say, the window of the corner video store, and I'm gripped by a cherishing so deep
                
    for my own blowing hair, chapped face, and unbuttoned coat that I'm speechless:
    I am living. I remember you.
